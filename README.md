# Ames Housing Data

## Objective: 

Create a Regression Model to predict housing price based on a house's features. This model will be used to estimate market value based on features of a house, such as number of bedrooms and location, which will be useful for users who are shopping for a house when negotiating price. Performance will be measured by difference between model prediction and actual house price.

### Tasks 
(based on Appendix B from Hands-on Machine Learning w/ SKLearn and TF by Aurelion Geron):
1.  Explore and Visualize Data [1 week]
  - Study feature:
    - Name
    - Type
    - % nan
    - Usefulness
    - Distribution
  - Identify target feature
  - Feature correlations
  - Brainstorm extra useful data
2. Clean and Prepare Data [1 week]
  - [O] Fix outliers
  - Missing values
  - Feature engineering and selection
  - Feature scaling
3. List Promising Models [1/2 week]
4. Fine-Tune Model [1/2 week]
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters
  - Ensemble Method
  - Make pipeline
  - Test model on test set for final performance
5. [Optional] Export model as usable app
  - as website or app
  - [F] allow users to enter only certain features of house and still make prediction
    - output how missing features affect prediction
6. [Optional] Add more diverse data 
  - web-scrape housing sales
